# My personal Arch Linux installation process

My goal for writing this personal guide:
- A simple checklist which works in my personal case
- Automating the post installation setup

## Disclaimer

This is my personal Arch Linux installation process. While it can help other 
people, it is a personal document. It does not aim to replace the excellent 
official installation guide which can be found at 
[Arch Linux Official Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide) . 
It is based on my personal preferences. Besides, it is not comprehensive and 
I am not including the parts which, for me, are straightforward (e.g. make a 
live USB, use iwctl to connect to the network during initial live boot etc.).
